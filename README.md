##SENTIMENT ANALYSIS: MOVIE REVIEW SYSTEM 
IMDB dataset having 50K movie reviews for natural language processing . 
This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification . 
We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. 
So,we have to predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification .

#MODEL 
-Logistic Regression
 -Naive Bayes 
-Support Vector machines(SVM)

#LIBRARIES REQUIRED
 -Matplotlib 
-Numpy 
-Pandas 
-Seaborn 
-Scipy 
-NLTK

#HOW TO RUN:
 -Run sentiment analysis review movie review system(simran).ipynb and make sure you have IMDB MOVIE REVIEW DATASET in your directory.

#RESULTS 
We can solve most binary classification problems using a similar strategy.
 -after execution : 
-Accuracy = 86% 
-Precision for negative reviews = 85% 
-Precision forpositive reviews = 87%
